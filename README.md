# Installation Steps (for windows) 
----------------------------------------
# Day1
### Step 1 - Install Ruby from official site (https://rubyinstaller.org/).    
### step 2 - To check it is properly installed or not. Type ruby -v (in cmd).   
### step 3 - Now install the gem using cmd(admin) -> gem install rails     
### step 4 - Check it is installed or not using command -> rails -v    
### step 5 - Then create app in a a seprate folder for rails use command -> rails new YOUR_APP_NAME    
### step 6 - Now navigate to the folder in cmd. Then run the command to start the server -> rails s   
### step 7 - Then copy the url (default 3000) and paste on the browser if it is working then it is successfully installed.   
### step 8 - If you want to change the port number then only use the command -> rails s -p YOUR_PORT_NUM.    

## Some rails commands 

#### create this rails application -> rails new App_Name -d  postgresql   (here d for custom database)
#### to start ther rails server -> rails s    
#### create rails database -> rails db:create     
#### now setup the database.yml file by pasting the code ->   
###### development:   
######  <<: *default     
######  database: postgres     
######  username: postgres    
######  password: YOUR_PASSWORD     

#### Then 

## Folder Structuring
#### app -> all files of MVC 
#### bin -> provides supports for the commands that we run
#### config -> helps to manage the configration for production,testing and development
###### config--> environments -->  for production,testing and development enviroments  
###### config--> locales (for which language you want to show to user)   
###### config--> importmap (related to liberary)   
###### config--> routes (by this url related query will be done)
#### db folder(all the database related queries like seeding, etc)    
#### log wil keep all the details about app like errors,time,response success/fail,etc    
#### public (will have public assets like favicon,png,images,etc)
#### tmp (for cache related files)
#### vendor (for third party liberary)   
#### Gemfile (keep liberary versions)


# DaySprings – Ruby & Rails Learning Notes

---

## Day 1 – Ruby & Rails Basics

### Ruby

* Ruby is a **dynamically typed**, **open-source** programming language known for **simplicity** and **developer productivity**.
* Everything in Ruby is an **object**.
* Latest stable version: **Ruby 3.x**.
* Ruby generally follows **SOLID principles** (with limited emphasis on Interface Segregation due to Ruby’s dynamic nature).

### Rails

* Rails is a **web application framework built on Ruby**.
* It helps developers build applications faster by providing conventions and boilerplate code.
* Latest major version: **Rails 8.x**.

* Ruby alone can create applications, but frameworks like Rails:

  * Reduce development time
  * Provide structure
  * Generate boilerplate code automatically

### Creating a Rails Project

Rails projects can be created in multiple ways:

1. `rails new project_name`
2. `rails new project_name --api` (API-only / two-tier architecture)
3. **Scaffold** (auto-creates MVC components)

### Commands to Remember

* `ruby --version`
* `rails --version`
* `gem install rails`
* `rails new ProjectName`

---

##  Day 2 – PostgreSQL, Scaffold & Console

### Project with PostgreSQL

Main database commands:

* `rails db:create` → Creates the database
* `rails db:migrate` → Applies schema changes
* `rails db:seed` → Inserts data from `seeds.rb` file(first create the seed.rb file).

* Correct order is important: **create → migrate → seed**

### Scaffold

* Scaffold generates the **complete skeleton** of an application:

  * Model
  * Controller
  * Views
  * Routes

Command: rails generate scaffold Customer name:string email:string     

Controller-only generation: rails generate controller Customers    

### Project Creation Commands

* rails new project_name
* rails new project_name -d postgresql
* rails new project_name -d postgresql --skip-test

### Rails Console

* rails console (provides an environment where we can run Rails commands).

---

##  Day 3 – Rails Features & File Structure

### Main Features

#### Syntactic Sugar (Rails auto-generates MVC components without writing everything manually).

#### Convention Over Configuration (Rails uses naming conventions to auto-configure behavior).

```bash
Naming Rules:
rails generate model Customer   (to generate Customer model, and first letter will be capital like here "Customer" )
```

### Config Folder

Controls how the Rails application behaves.

Important files:

* `config/database.yml` → Database configuration
* `config/routes.rb` → Maps URLs to controllers
* `config/application.rb` → Main app configuration
* `config/environment.rb` → App entry point
* `config/environments/` → environment-specific settings


##  Day 4 – app Folder & Ruby Basics

### app Folder

Main application code lives here.

* **controllers** → Handle requests & responses
* **views** → UI files (`.html.erb`)
* **models** → Database logic
* **javascript** → Frontend behavior (Rails 8 integration)
* **mailers** → Sending emails
* **jobs** → Background tasks

### Ruby Data Types

* String (mutable)
* Numbers (integer, float) 
* Symbol (immutable)
* Boolean (true, false, nil)
* Arrays
* Hashes

All data types are objects.

### Variables

* Local → `name`
* Global → `$name`
* Instance → `@name`
* Class → `@@name`
* Constant → `NAME`

---

## Day 5 – Methods, Type Casting & Product Scaffold

* Single-line → `#`   
* Multi-line → `=begin`  `=end`  

### Type Casting

* User input is always a **String**.
* Ruby does **not** do implicit type casting.
* so for the integer inputs we need to convert it into number.

Examples:

* `"10".to_i`
* `10.to_s`
* `"10.5".to_f`

### Product Scaffold

* Command: rails generate scaffold Product name:string description:text price:decimal stock:integer is_active:boolean

* After any DB-related change run: rails db:migrate


### Ways to Insert Data

1. **UI** (Rails-generated forms)
2. **Manual SQL (DBeaver)**
3. **Seeds file (`db/seeds.rb`)**
4. **Rails Console**

Example SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO product1s (name, description, price, stock, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('IQ', 'The IQ new product', 80, 2, TRUE, '2026-01-16', '2026-01-16');
```

Example seed:

```ruby
Product1.create(name: "P1", description: "The P1 product", price: 900, stock: 30, is_active: true)
```
---

**Day 6 – Ruby Loops & Enumerable Methods**

##  Ruby Loops

### `for` Loop

Used when the range or count is known.

```ruby
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

for i in 10..15   # inclusive range
  print i
end
```

Key Points:

* Automatically increments
* Manual increment does not work
* `..` includes both start and end values

---

### `while` Loop

Executes while the condition is true.

```ruby
i = 0
while i <= 10
  puts i
  i += 1
end
```

Key Points:

* Condition checked before execution
* Manual initialization and increment required

---

### `loop do`

Infinite loop with explicit exit condition.

```ruby
k = 0
loop do
  puts "student : #{k}"
  k += 1
  break if k > 30
end
```

Key Points:

* Runs continuously
* `break` is mandatory to stop

---

### `until` Loop

Opposite of `while`.

```ruby
c = 0
until c > 15
  puts c
  c += 1
end
```

Key Points:

* Runs when the condition will be false

---

### Loop Control Keywords

```text
break → exits the loop
next  → skips current iteration
redo  → repeats current iteration
```

---

##  Enumerable Methods

### Array Used

```ruby
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
```

---

### `select` and `select!`

```ruby
arr.select { |num| num > 4 }
arr.select! { |num| num > 4 }
```

Key Difference:

* `select` returns filtered values
* `select!` modifies the original array

---

### `reject` and `reject!`

```ruby
arr.reject { |num| num > 2 }
arr.reject! { |num| num > 2 }
```

Key Difference:

* `reject` keeps original array unchanged
* `reject!` permanently modifies it

---

### `any?` and `all?`

```ruby
arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

arr2.any? { |num| num > 5 }
arr2.all? { |num| num > 0 }
```

Meaning:

* `any?` → at least one condition is true
* `all?` → all conditions are true

---

### `map`, `collect`, `each`

```ruby
arr2.map { |num| num ** 2 }
arr2.collect { |num| num ** 2 }
arr2.each { |num| num ** 2 }
```

Key Difference:

* `map` and `collect` return a new array
* `each` returns the original array

---

## Key Learning (Day 6)

* Ruby offers multiple loop types for different scenarios
* Enumerable methods reduce manual looping
* Methods end with `!` change the data in-place (does changes in same array)

---
**Day 7 – Ruby OOPS (Inheritance & Method Overriding)**
---
### Classes & Objects

* A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
* An object is an instance of a class.
* Methods define the behavior of an object.
* Instance variables (`@variable`) store object-specific data.

---

### Inheritance

* Inheritance allows one class to reuse another class’s methods and variables.
* Child classes inherit behavior from parent classes using `<` symbol.
* Helps reduce code duplication.
* Parent instance variables are accessible in child classes.

---

### Method Overriding

* Child class can redefine a method from the parent class also known as Overriding.   
* Ruby always calls the child method first if names match.  

---

### `super` Keyword

* `super` calls the parent class method.
* Can be used with or without arguments.
* Helps extend parent functionality instead of replacing it.

---

### Method Lookup

* Ruby searches for methods in this order:

  1. Current class
  2. Parent class
  3. Object(kernel,module)
  4. Basic Object

* `ancestors` shows the method lookup whole chain.

---

### Built-in Reflection Methods

* `respond_to?` checks if an object can respond to a method.
* Useful for safer method calls and debugging.

---

### Method Overriding Example (Concept)

* Same method name in parent and child.
* Parent logic can be reused using `super`.
* Child method changes output or behavior.

---

**Day 8 – Conditional Statements & Methods in Ruby**
---
## 1. Conditional Statements

### if / else

Check a condition and run code accordingly:

```ruby
stock = 20
if stock > 0
  puts "Item available"
else
  puts "Item not available"
end
```

### Ternary Operator

Shorter version of if/else:

```ruby
is_active = true
puts is_active ? "Active" : "Not Active"
```

### elsif

Check multiple conditions in sequence:

```ruby
price = 250
if price < 200
  discount = 10
elsif price < 300
  discount = 20
else
  discount = 5
end
puts discount
```

### case / when

Cleaner way to check multiple values:

```ruby
case price
when 100..200 then discount = 10
when 201..300 then discount = 20
else discount = 5
end
puts discount
```

### unless

Runs code only if the condition is false (it is opposite of if):

```ruby
email = nil
puts "Email missing" unless email
```

---

## 2. Methods & Access Modifiers

Ruby lets you control who can use your methods:

* public → accessible anywhere
* private → can only be called inside the class
* protected → accessible in class and subclasses

Example:

```ruby
class Product
  def public_method
    puts "I am public"
  end

  private
  def private_method
    puts "I am private"
  end
end
```

**Day 9 Rails Models: Customer & Product Validations**

## Customer Model (`Customer < ApplicationRecord`)
---

### **Built-in Validations**

* Name is **required** and limited to 3–20 characters:

```ruby
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 3, maximum: 20 }
```

* Email is **required** and **unique**:

```ruby
validates :email, presence: true, uniqueness: true
```

### **Custom Validations**

* **Profanity check** for `name` and `email`:

```ruby
validate :deny_profanity

def deny_profanity
  profanity_words = /lopper|nonsence|idiot/i
  errors.add(:name, "is inappropriate") if name =~ profanity_words
  errors.add(:email, "is inappropriate") if email =~ profanity_words
end
```

* Check if email is present:

```ruby
def check_email
  email.present?
end
```

### **Usage Example (Rails Console)**

```ruby
customer = Customer.first
customer.check_email
customer.check_name
```

---

## Product Model (`Product < ApplicationRecord`)

### **Built-in Validations**

* Name, description, stock, price, and is_active are validated:

```ruby
validates :name, presence: true, length: { minimum: 4, maximum: 30 }
validates :price, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 1 }
validates :stock, numericality: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 1 }, length: { maximum: 500 }
validates :description, length: { minimum: 8, maximum: 460 }, format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+\z/, message: "only letters, numbers, and spaces allowed" }
validates :is_active, presence: true, acceptance: true, if: :price?
validates :stock, presence: true, if: :is_active?
```

### **Custom Validation**

* Ensure `is_active` is checked only if `price` and `stock` are present:

```ruby
validate :check_is_active

def check_is_active
  if is_active? && (price.blank? || stock.blank?)
    errors.add(:is_active, "cannot be checked unless price and stock are filled out")
  end
end
```

### **Helper Methods**

* **Check description validity**:

```ruby
def check_validity
  description =~ /\A[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+\z/
end
```

* **Check stock availability**:

```ruby
def check_availability
  stock > 0
end
```

**Apply discount**:

```ruby
def apply_discount(discount_percentage)
  price - (price * discount_percentage / 100)
end
```

 **Calculate total amount** (with discount and stock check):

```ruby
def total_amount
  if check_availability
    apply_discount(10).round
  else
    "Item is not available"
  end
end
```

## Notes with some imp points about code ...-->


1. **Built-in validations cover most use-cases**

   * Presence, uniqueness, numericality, length, format, acceptance, inclusion/exclusion.
   * Saves time and keeps code DRY.

2. **Custom validations enforce business rules**

   * For example:

     * Profanity filters (`deny_profanity`)
     * Stock-price relationships
     * Conditional validations (`is_active` only if price & stock exist)

3. **Use helper methods in models**

   * Methods like `check_availability`, `apply_discount`, `total_amount` make logic reusable and testable.

4. **Always check dependencies**

   * Example: `is_active` cannot be true unless `price` and `stock` are present.
   * Helps maintain **data integrity**.

5. **Display errors properly in views**

   * Use `@model.errors.full_messages` to show user-friendly error messages.
   * Prevents saving invalid data and improves UX.

6. **Use format validations to restrict unwanted input**

   * Avoid special characters in fields like `name` and `description`.
   * Example: `/\A[a-zA-Z0-9 ]+\z/`

7. **Conditional validations are powerful**

   * Use `if:` or `unless:` to run validations only under certain conditions.
   * Example: `validates :stock, presence: true, if: :is_active?`

8. **Never manually edit `schema.rb` or database fields**

   * Always use **migrations** to make changes.
   * Prevents schema inconsistency.

9. **Keep validation errors concise and informative**

   * Helps users understand what went wrong without confusing messages.

10. **Test validations in Rails console**

    * Always try creating invalid and valid records in the console to confirm your rules work.

**Day 10 – Rails Scopes**

A **scope** is a custom query defined in a Rails model. It is mainly used when the same query is needed multiple times.
---

## Scope Examples

### 1. Out of Stock product1s

Fetch product1s whose stock is zero or less.

```ruby
scope :out_of_stock, -> { where("stock <= ?", 0) }
#or
scope :out_of_stock, -> { where(stock: 0) }
```

---

### 2. Writing Custom / Raw SQL Query

Scopes can also contain raw SQL queries.

```ruby
scope :test_scope, -> { query {} }
```

---

### 3. Whitelisted product1s

Fetch product1s whose IDs are in a given list.

```ruby
scope :whitelisted_product1s, -> { where("id IN (?)", [1, 2, 3]) }
```

---

### 4. Unique Emails

Fetch distinct email values from records.

```ruby
scope :unique_emails, -> { where(email: "sudha@gmail.com").select(:email).distinct }
```

---

### 5. Blacklisted Customers (Parameterized Scope)

Scopes can accept parameters.

```ruby
scope :blacklisted_customers, ->(customer_ids) { where(id: customer_ids) }
```

Usage:

```ruby
@customers = Customer.blacklisted_customers([3, 6, 9, 10])
```

---

## Method Chaining

Scopes can be chained together because they return ActiveRecord relations.

Example:

```ruby
Product.out_of_stock.whitelisted_product1s
```

---

## Controller Examples ---like how will use

### Customers Controller

```ruby
def index
  @customers = Customer.all
  # @customers = Customer.blacklisted_customers([1,2,3])
end
```

---

### product1s Controller

```ruby
def index
  @product1s = Product.out_of_stock
end
```

---

**Day 11 -> Republic Day (no task given)**

**Day 12 - Notes**

| Component Name        | Available From (Rails) | What it is / Why it is used                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Active Model**      | Rails 3.0              | Provides model features like validations and callbacks **without a database**. Used when you don’t need DB tables. |
| **Active Record**     | Rails 1.0              | ORM layer. Connects Rails to database, handles CRUD, migrations, and represents table rows as Ruby objects.        |
| **Action Controller** | Rails 1.0              | Handles browser requests, talks to models, and sends data to views. Acts as the app’s manager.                     |
| **Action View**       | Rails 1.0              | Generates HTML using ERB/HAML and displays data received from controller.                                          |
| **Action Dispatch**   | Rails 1.0              | Handles routing and decides which controller and action should handle a request.                                   |
| **Action Mailer**     | Rails 1.0              | Used to send emails like welcome emails, password reset, notifications, etc.                                       |
| **Active Support**    | Rails 1.0              | Utility library that extends Ruby with helpers like date, time, string helpers.                                    |
| **Active Job**        | Rails 4.2              | Manages background jobs (long-running tasks like emails, reports). Works with Sidekiq, Resque, etc.                |
| **Action Cable**      | Rails 5.0              | Provides WebSocket support for real-time features like chat and live notifications.                                |
| **Active Storage**    | Rails 5.2              | Handles file uploads (images, videos, documents) and stores them locally or on cloud (S3, etc.).                   |


### Task 1. Generating a Controller 
* rails generate controller admin
* Rails creates files related to controller and views (Action Pack).
* these are the file will be genereted
```ruby 
app/controllers/admin_controller.rb → controller file   
app/views/admin/ → folder admin views    
app/helpers/admin_helper.rb → helper file   
test/controllers/admin_controller_test.rb → controller test file   
```
--- 

### Task 2. Generating a Model
* To generate: 
```ruby 
rails generate model admin
```

```ruby 
app/models/admin.rb → model file
db/migrate/XXXXXXXX_create_admins.rb → migration file
test/models/admin_test.rb → model test file
test/fixtures/admins.yml → test data

then run this command: rails db:migrate is used to modify the database schema   
```
* If we Deleting show.html.erb file
* Error: ActionController::UnknownFormat in CustomersController#show CustomersController#show is missing a template for this request format.

why?
Show action(method) exists in the controller and when we hit that url it will try to call the show.html.erb view file, which is missing.

---

### Task 3 (Try this in routes):
```ruby 
resources :products, except: [:show]
resources :products, only: [:new, :destroy]
```
* To skip a route from being created via resources we use except
* To create only a specific set of routes we use only.  
* Then If we try to open show page
* URL: /products/1    -> (here 1 is id to show)  
```ruby 
Error we get: We will get this error,ActionController::RoutingError , No route matches [GET] "/products/1"
```

--- 

**Day 13 (add_column, action_text)**

### Some routes commands:

```ruby 
rails route
rails route | grep product_path
```

### ⚠️Note: WE SHOULD NOT MODIFY THE schema.rb (db file)

## Concepts

### For adding column in your Database (follow the case):
```ruby 
command : rails generate migration className_with_tableName column_name:datatype_based_sql

Ex:- rails generate migration AddColumnPhoneToCustomer1 phone_number:integer

Then Run: rails db:migrate
```
* then add that excate column name in table_name_controller.
* In here we need to pass proper readable classname with attached table name and then column_name as we want.
* then check in Your schema.rb it is added or not.

### Steps to create action text (in you form).
* before installing check your app folder inside your applicaiton, javascript folder is present or not. 
* Then check inside or search using ctrl+p (better) about these files are present or not.
```ruby
 1) applicaiton.js
 2) importmap.rb
```

* if not present run below commands:

```ruby
for rails version 8 -> rails importmap:install
for rails version 7 -> rails javascript:install
```

* to bring rich text editing capabilities to your Rails application form like (adding media files, adding underlines,itallic,bullets point in the textarea,etc).

* Then run below command: 

```ruby 
command : rails action_text:install
```
* This will modify above mentioned file two of the file and create a new file with actiontext.css in app/assets/stylesheet

## Tasks :

### 1) compare the difference between schema.rb file before and after installation action_text.

* after installation we got some changes :
```begin
  1) create_table "action_text_rich_texts"
  2) create_table "active_storage_attachments"
  3) create_table "active_storage_blobs"
  4) create_table "active_storage_variant_records"
  5) add_foreign_key "active_storage_attachments"
  6) add_foreign_key "active_storage_variant_records"

  these are the some code snippets added.
```  

### 2) Inspect in each controller method and acknowledgement using below command:

```ruby
  rails params:inspect
```

### 3) create two array and check intersection output (&) between them.

```ruby
a1 = [1,2,3,6,3,nil,4,5,nil,6,nil,"",""]
a2 = [1,4,2,4,7,9]

p a1&a2     # [1, 2, 4]
p "------"
p a1&a1     # [1, 2, 3, 6, nil, 4, 5, ""]
# we are getting the distinct value when we are doing intersect with same array
```

### 4) Implement action_text in Product and Customer table 

* Did changes in the code for implementing it in.
```begin
steps 1: model/product.rb
steps 2: product_controller.rb(in that product_params action)
steps 3: write in view (_form, _edit,etc).
```

---

**Day 14 (active_storage, column_adding_migration)**

## Tasks :

### 1) create column for invoice through attachment (has_one_attached) in product table

* Step 1: add this in table.rb (model) file -> has_one_attached:column_name
* step 2: add the same col_name (in symbol form) in def customer1_params of controller.  
* step 3: then implement it in the view wherever needed(in html.erb files). 

### 2) create column dateofbirth(DOB) in customer using generate migration.

* Step 1: run the command-> rails generate migration Add/RemoveColumnCol_nameToTab_name col_name:datatype (based on sql)
```ruby 
Ex : rails generate migration AddColumnBirthDateToCustomer1 birth_date:date
```
* step 2: then run -> rails db:migrate
* step 3: check schema.rb it is added or not.

### 3) Form helpers (rails docs)


## Concepts:

### For active storage installation
```ruby
rails active_storage:installing
```

### Sequence Order for writing in model.rb file (good practice)

* 1) action_text/storage
* 2) validation
* 3) scopes
* 4) methods

### For multiple data adding/selection using html.erb add -> multiple:true (in .html.erb file)
---

**Day 15 (Action_Mailer)**

## Tasks : create Order table in same application
* Step 1 generate model with col names(details:string, count:int)
* Step 2 generate controller
* Step 3 run db:migrate
* Step 4 empty controller and view files will be generated we need to add code to all the classes now Perform CRUD

* Action Mailer is used to send emails from a Rails application.This class is present in rails since begining.
* It is commonly used for:
  * Welcome emails
  * Password reset emails
  * Notifications
* In development mode, we use **Letter Opener** to preview emails in the browser instead of sending real emails.

## Steps

### Step 1: Generate Mailer

```ruby
command : rails generate mailer CustomerMailer
```

* This creates:
  1) `app/mailers/customer_mailer.rb`
  2) `app/views/customer_mailer/` (folder for email templates)

### Step 2: Enable Action Mailer

* Open → `config/application.rb`
* Add below line:

```ruby
require "action_mailer/railtie"
```

* This loads Rails mailer functionality into your application.

### Step 3: Configure Development Environment

* Open → `config/environments/development.rb`
* Add:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
```

* Meaning:

  * `perform_deliveries = true`
    → Allows sending emails  

  * `delivery_method = :letter_opener`
    → Opens emails in browser instead of sending real emails  

### Step 4: Write Mailer Logic

* Open → `app/mailers/customer_mailer.rb`

```ruby
class CustomerMailer < ApplicationMailer
  def welcome_email
    @customer = params[:customer]
    mail(to: @customer.email, subject: "Welcome to my app...")
  end
end
```

* What happens here:

  * Receives customer data using `params`
  * Sends email to customer's email address
  * Sets subject line

### Step 5: Create Mailer View (Email Template)

Create file:

`app/views/customer_mailer/welcome_email.html.erb`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta content='text/html; charset=UTF-8' http-equiv='Content-Type' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to New Connection App, <%= @customer.name %>!</h1>
    <p>
      You have successfully joined this community
      your email is: <%= @customer.email %>.<br>
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for joining and have a fun-tastic day!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

* This is the actual email template that users will receive.

### Step 6: Trigger Email from Controller

* Open → `customers_controller.rb`
* Add:

```ruby
CustomerMailer.with(customer: @customer).welcome_email.deliver
```

* When customer is created → welcome email is sent automatically.

### Step 7: Add Required Gems

In `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "letter_opener", group: :development
gem "letter_opener_web", group: :development
```

Then run:

```ruby
bundle install
```

* These gems:
  * Prevent real email sending in development
  * Open emails in browser

### Step 8: Add Route for Email Preview

In `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
if Rails.env.development?
  mount LetterOpenerWeb::Engine, at: "/letter_opener"
end
```

Now visit in browser:

```ruby
http://localhost:3000/letter_opener
```

* All sent emails will be visible here.

## Flow Summary

1) Generate Mailer  
2) Enable Action Mailer  
3) Configure Development Settings  
4) Write Mailer Method  
5) Create Email Template  
6) Trigger from Controller  
7) Add Gems  
8) Preview Emails in Browser  


# Day 16 – Action Mailbox (Receiving Emails in Rails)

## Concepts

### What is Action Mailbox?
* Action Mailbox is used to receive incoming emails in a Rails application.
* It routes emails to mailboxes.
* It processes email content inside the application.
* Useful for:
  * Support systems
  * Contact forms via email
  * Automated email-based workflows

## Tasks : No Task

### 1) Install Action Mailbox

```ruby
command : rails action_mailbox:install
```

* Generated files:

  1) `app/mailboxes/application_mailbox.rb`  
  2) `db/migrate/XXXXX_create_action_mailbox_tables.action_mailbox.rb`

### 2) Run Database Migration

```ruby
command : rails db:migrate
```

* Table created:

  * `action_mailbox_inbound_emails`

* Purpose:
  * Stores all incoming emails.
  * Tracks status of received emails.

### 3) Production Configuration

* Open → `config/environments/production.rb`

Add:

```ruby
config.action_mailbox.ingress = :any_ingress_server
```

* Default ingress is:

```ruby
:relay
```

* Ingress defines how emails enter your Rails application.

### 4) Application Mailbox Routing

* Open → `app/mailboxes/application_mailbox.rb`

```ruby
class ApplicationMailbox < ActionMailbox::Base
  routing all: :support
end
```

* Meaning:

  * All incoming emails are routed to `SupportMailbox`.

### 5) Generate Support Mailbox

```ruby
command : rails generate mailbox support
```

* Generated files:

  1) `app/mailboxes/support_mailbox.rb`  
  2) `test/mailboxes/support_mailbox_test.rb`

### 6) Support Mailbox Logic

* Open → `app/mailboxes/support_mailbox.rb`

```ruby
class SupportMailbox < ApplicationMailbox
  def process
    # this action is for processing emails 
    # Mail.decoded # for fetching mail body
    # Mail.from    # f\from whom mail was sent
    # Mail.subject # give the subject
  end
end
```

* The `process` method:
  * Handles incoming email data.
  * Allows you to store email content.
  * Can trigger business logic.

### 7) View Incoming Emails (Development Mode)

Start server:

```ruby
rails s
```

Open in browser (at this link incoming Emails will be Present):

```
http://127.0.0.1:3000/rails/conductor/action_mailbox/inbound_emails
```

You can:

* View inbound emails  
* Create test emails using form or raw source  
* Check message ID  
* Check delivery status  

## Flow Summary

1) Install Action Mailbox  
2) Run Migration  
3) Configure Ingress  
4) Set Routing in ApplicationMailbox  
5) Generate Custom Mailbox  
6) Define process Method  
7) View & Test Incoming Emails

# Day 17 – Namespaced Models & Active Record Methods



## 1) Creating Namespaced Model (Under a Model)

### Generate Migration for Namespaced Model

```ruby
command : rails generate migration Modelname::NamedscopeModelname
```

Example:

```ruby
rails generate migration Product::Category
```

Then run:

```ruby
rails db:migrate
```

This creates a namespaced structure like:

```
app/models/product/category.rb
```



## 2) Adding Column to Namespaced Model

```ruby
command : rails generate migration AddColumnToModel_Name column:datatype
```

Example:

```ruby
rails generate migration AddColumnCategory_nameToProductCategory category_name:string
```

Then:

```ruby
rails db:migrate
```



# Active Record Methods

### Insert Methods

```ruby
Model_name.insert({column: value, column: value})

Model_name.insert({})

Model_name.insert_all([{},{},{},...])
```

* `insert` → inserts single record (without validations/callbacks)
* `insert_all` → inserts multiple records at once



### Find Methods

```ruby
Model.find(id)
```
* Returns record if present  
* Raises exception if not found  

```ruby
Model.find_by(id: id)
```
* Returns record if present  
* Returns `nil` if not found  



### Record Position Methods

```ruby
Model.first
Model.second
Model.third
Model.fourth
Model.fifth
Model.last
```

Used to fetch records based on position.

# Summary

## Day 17
* Namespaced Models
* Adding columns to namespaced tables
* Active Record insert & find methods

# Day 18 – Active Support & Core Extensions


## 1) Core Extensions

Rails provides extra helper methods via **Active Support**.

These methods are not part of pure Ruby — they are available only inside Rails.


## Date & Time Calculations

### Current Time

```ruby
Time.zone.now
```

Example:

```ruby
a = Time.zone.now
a + 2.day
a + 3.week
a + 3.month
a + 2.hour
a + 2.days
```

Rails automatically understands:

* `n.day`
* `n.days`
* `n.week`
* `n.month`
* `n.hour`

Example Output:

```
2026-02-04 05:42:22 UTC
a + 2.day  => 2026-02-06
a + 3.week => 2026-02-25
a + 3.month => 2026-05-04
```


## Date Methods

```ruby
Date.today
Date.new(year, month, day)
```

Beginning & End Methods:

```ruby
Date.today.beginning_of_day
Date.today.beginning_of_week
Date.today.beginning_of_month
Date.today.beginning_of_year
```

```ruby
Date.today.end_of_day
Date.today.end_of_week
Date.today.end_of_month
Date.today.end_of_year
```


## 2) Instrumentation (Pub/Sub)

* Rails supports Publish-Subscribe pattern.
* Used internally for logging, monitoring, performance tracking.


## 3) ActiveSupport::Concern

* Used to organize shared modules cleanly.
* Helps in writing reusable logic.
* Avoids manual `included do` boilerplate issues.


## 4) Multi-language Translations (I18n)

Rails uses `I18n` module for translations.

Configuration file:

```
config/locales/en.yml
```

I18n stores translation keys and values.

Example:

```ruby
I18n.t("welcome.message")
```


## 5) Active Support Utility Methods

These methods work on Strings, Arrays, Hashes, Objects.

### Blank / Present / Nil / Empty

```ruby
" ".blank?    # true
[].blank?     # true
{}.blank?     # true
```

```ruby
" ".nil?      # false
[].nil?       # false
{}.nil?       # false
```

```ruby
" ".present?  # false
[].present?   # false
{}.present?   # false
```

```ruby
"".empty?     # true
[].empty?     # true
{}.empty?     # true
```

### Difference Between Them

| Method | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| blank? | true if empty or whitespace |
| present? | opposite of blank? |
| nil? | checks if object is nil |
| empty? | checks if collection/string length is zero |


# Summary

## Day 18
* Active Support core extensions
* Date & Time calculations
* Instrumentation
* ActiveSupport::Concern
* I18n translations
* blank?, present?, empty?, nil? methods
